# Alzheimer_Capstone

Executive Summary

I’ve decided to do my capstone on Alzheimer Disease. Growing as a kid my
grandmother began to show signs of Alzheimer’s before passing away. Is Alzheimer’s
hereditary or is it based off of gender or race? Is it becoming more common?

Motivation

I mentioned my grandmother having Alzheimer’s growing as a kid. It would be
difficult to speak with her as she remembered me as a younger child. It began to hurt
my mother more than anything. As I do my research, I would like to discover if there’s
a common denominator behind Alzheimers.

Data Question

Who is more acceptable to Alzheimer’s? Is it more common in male or female? Or if ethnicity
play a factor as well?
What is the most common age for Alzheimer?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

My MVP will consist of a map of the US showing over time areas the show an increase
or decrease of Alzheimer’s in each state. I’ll have graphs to support the map base of
age, ethnicity, health or heredity.

Known Issues and Challenges

I’m anticipating running into a few walls with understanding some of the terminology
for heath care. Also, wanting create a geojson of the country showing over time
where certain areas have either seen an increase or decrease of Alzheimer’s. I believe
that it will also be difficult to clean the data and merge them together.
